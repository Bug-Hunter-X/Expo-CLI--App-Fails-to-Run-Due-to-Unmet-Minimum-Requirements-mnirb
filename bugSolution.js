Ensure your `app.json` or `expo.json` file accurately reflects the minimum requirements of your application and the capabilities of your target devices. For example, check:

* **`expo.ios.supportsTablet`:** If your app is only designed for iPhones, set this to `false`. 
* **`expo.android.minSdkVersion`:**  Set this to a value compatible with the oldest Android version you want to support.  Too high a value will prevent the app from running on older devices. 
* **`expo.android.versionCode`:** Use an appropriate version code for your Android app.
* **`expo.web.config`:** Adjust this section if you're targeting web deployment, making sure that all requirements are met for the targeted browsers.

If you are using specific libraries or features with version requirements, make sure these also meet your specified minimum requirements.  If these are not compatible with your minimum requirement specs, either upgrade the requirements or find alternative libraries.
